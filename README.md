# AutoSpeedtests-and-Wifi-Speed-Analysis
This repository contains a project to create an API which automates command line speedtests by leveraging the Ookla Speedtest
capabilities. The script then produces a plot of the download speed, upload speed, latency, and jitter of the connection over time in
order to better understand the nature of the connection over a period of time.
